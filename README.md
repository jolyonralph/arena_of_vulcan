This was a game I wrote in BASIC (first for the ICL 2904 mainframe, and then for the ZX Spectrum) in 1983/4. The original coding for this game was written on pen on the card insert that came in a new school shirt, and then faithfully typed into the ICL at Rutlish School, Merton, when I got there the next day.
